Credits Explanations (please read:)

This documents lists down the parts of example projects we had copied from, 
as well as projects we took reference/learned from (not copy).

. We only copied basic variable definitions and simple functions
So the copied parts only make up a small part of our projects.

. As for the listed reference projects, we did not copy them, but rather learned from these projects to make our own.

  Hence, certain parts of the code may appear similar to part of the reference projects.
  (Such as structure of program flow)

--------------------------------------------------------------------

We copied only parts from the following projects:

1. https://learn.tinycircuits.com/Kits/TinyScreen-Smart-Watch-Kit_Tutorial/
From the IOS Example

We copied only 2 simple functions and 1 object structure.
 . BLEConnection object structure from the BLETypes.h of the example.
 . initSecurity() and requestSecurity() functions from BlueNRG.io .

2. https://os.mbed.com/users/bowenfeng/code/BLE_HID/

We only copied the object structures/ variable definitions from this example, to use for setting up BLE characteristics
They are mostly in 
HIDServiceBase.h and MouseService.h

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Next, We took reference to the following projects. 
We did not copy them, but rather learned from these projects to make our own.

Hence, certain parts of the code may appear similar to part of the projects.
(Such as structure of program flow)


-----------------------------------------------------------------------

We took reference/learn from the following: (Not Copy, just reference)

1. https://learn.tinycircuits.com/Kits/TinyScreen-Smart-Watch-Kit_Tutorial/
Used as reference to set up structure of initialising BLE connection and pairing, as well as some BLE event handling

2. https://os.mbed.com/users/bowenfeng/code/BLE_HID/
Used as reference to understand BLE services and characteristics

3. https://github.com/TinyCircuits/TinyCircuits-TinyShield-BLE-ASD2116/tree/master/examples/STBLE/examples/UARTPassThrough
From UART.ino
Used as reference to learn how to properly store UUID, as well as some BLE event handling

4. https://github.com/PixlRainbow/TinyCircuits-TinyShield-BLE-ASD2116/tree/a4f926d72a8e6264ea06030a27de2e3c9c63afe9/examples/STBLE/examples/BLEKeyboard

A public fork of (3), with a keyboard HID service/char setup code.
Used as a reference to setup mouse services/characteristics.
(4) most likely also references (2) as well


Library used: STBLE.h, ...

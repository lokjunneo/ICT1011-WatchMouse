# ICT 1011 Project

## Libraries 
You will need to install the TinyScreen library.
You will need to install STBLE.h. I have included the library in the zip file as well
To install it, go to your Arduino IDE, at the menu bar, choose sketch > include library > add .ZIP library

Credits to TinyCiruit for providing the STBLE.h library
